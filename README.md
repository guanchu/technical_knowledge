# Simple Neural Networks
This is a repo for building a simple Neural Net based only on **[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)**.

The usage is similar to [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).
There are only limited codes involved to be functional.
Unlike those popular but complex packages such as Tensorflow and Pytorch,
you can dig into my source codes smoothly.

The main purpose of this repo is for you
to understand the code rather than implementation.
So please feel free to read the codes.
